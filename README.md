# WordPress-TranslatorContributors

Sort of API-endpoint to fetch editors and contributors to your WordPress-plugins language packs.

You need to create a directory called `wp-cache` in the same place where the `wp-translator-contributors.php` is located, and the web server should have access to write in it, to save cached responses.
